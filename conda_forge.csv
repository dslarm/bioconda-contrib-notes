Linear problems are solved by dense QR decomposition from 'LAPACK' which can limit the size of treated problems. On the other side, we avoid condition number degradation which happens in classical quadratic programming approach. Inequality constraints treatment on each non linear iteration is based on 'NNLS' method (by Lawson and Hanson). We provide an original function 'lsi_ln' for solving linear least squares problem with inequality constraints in least norm sens. Thus if Jacobian of the problem is rank deficient a solution still can be provided. However, truncation errors are probable in this case. Equality constraints are treated by using a basis of Null-space. User defined function calculating residuals must return a list having residual vector (not their squared sum) and Jacobian. If Jacobian is not in the returned list, package 'numDeriv' is used to calculated finite difference version of Jacobian. The 'NLSIC' method was fist published in Sokol et al.

1323,r-surveillance,public,"Statistical methods for the modeling and monitoring of time series of counts, proportions and categorical data, as well as for the modeling of continuous-time point processes of epidemic phenomena. The monitoring methods focus on aberration detection in count data time series from public health surveillance of communicable diseases, but applications could just as well originate from environmetrics, reliability engineering, econometrics, or social sciences. The package implements many typical outbreak detection procedures such as the (improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative binomial GLR-CUSUM method of Höhle and Paul (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015>. A novel CUSUM approach combining logistic and multinomial logistic modeling is also included. The package contains several real-world data sets, the ability to simulate outbreak data, and to visualize the results of the monitoring in a temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal fashion. A recent overview of the available monitoring procedures is given by Salmon et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>. For the retrospective analysis of epidemic spread, the package provides three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools for visualization, likelihood inference, and simulation. hhh4() estimates models for (multivariate) count time series following Paul and Held (2011) <doi:10.1002/sim.4177> and Meyer and Held (2014) <doi:10.1214/14-AOAS743>. twinSIR() models the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event history of a fixed population, e.g, epidemics across farms or networks, as a multivariate point process as proposed by Höhle (2009) <doi:10.1002/bimj.200900050>. twinstim() estimates self-exciting point process models for a spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events, e.g., time-stamped geo-referenced surveillance data, as proposed by Meyer et al. (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01684.x>. A recent overview of the implemented space-time modeling frameworks for epidemic phenomena is given by Meyer et al.

Functions are provided for writing balanced reactions to form species from user-selected basis species and for calculating the standard molal properties of species and reactions, including the standard Gibbs energy and equilibrium constant. Calculations of the non-equilibrium chemical affinity and equilibrium chemical activity of species can be portrayed on diagrams as a function of temperature, pressure, or activity of basis species; in two dimensions, this gives a maximum affinity or predominance diagram. The diagrams have formatted chemical formulas and axis labels, and water stability limits can be added to Eh-pH, oxygen fugacity- temperature, and other diagrams with a redox variable. The package has been developed to handle common calculations in aqueous geochemistry, such as solubility due to complexation of metal ions, mineral buffers of redox or pH, and changing the basis species across a diagram (""mosaic diagrams""). CHNOSZ also implements a group additivity algorithm for the standard thermodynamic properties of proteins.",2025-06-20

The Table Generator allows users to drag and drop variables and desired statistics (frequencies, means, ANOVA, t-test, and other summary statistics) into bins that automagically create stunning tables with validated information. The Population Explorer offers various plots to visualize general trends in the population from various vantage points. Plot modules currently include scatter plot, spaghetti plot, box plot, histogram, means plot, and bar plot. Each plot type allows the user to plot uploaded variables against one another, and dissect the population by filtering out certain subjects. Last, the Individual Explorer establishes a cohesive patient narrative, allowing the user to interact with patient metrics (params) by visit or plotting important patient events on a timeline.

The methods are motivated by genetic fine-mapping applications, and are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse. The fitting algorithm, a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods called ""Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection"" (IBSS), is simple and fast, allowing the SuSiE model be fit to large data sets (thousands of samples and hundreds of thousands of variables).",2025-06-06

The simplest way to evaluate an expression in parallel is to use `x %<-% { expression }` with `plan(multiprocess)`. This package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and cluster futures. With these, R expressions can be evaluated on the local machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed on a mix of local and remote machines. Extensions to this package implement additional backends for processing futures via compute cluster schedulers etc. Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed processing on a remote compute cluster. Another strength of this package is that global variables and functions are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it straightforward to tweak existing code to make use of futures.",2025-06-05
3703,r-synthpop,public,"A tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata containing confidential information so that they are safe to be released to users for exploratory analysis. The key objective of generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information contained in the data set. Variables, which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and regression trees models. Data are synthesised via the function syn() which can be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods defined by the user. Optional parameters can be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the synthesised data.

This non-parametric class of regression trees is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Based on conditional inference trees, cforest() provides an implementation of Breiman's random forests. The function mob() implements an algorithm for recursive partitioning based on parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or survival regression) employing parameter instability tests for split selection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-structured regression models is available. The methods are described in Hothorn et al. (2006) <doi:10.1198/106186006X133933>, Zeileis et al.

Focused mainly on two-dimensional point patterns, including multitype/marked points, in any spatial region. Also supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point patterns in any number of dimensions, point patterns on a linear network, and patterns of other geometrical objects. Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images. Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks. Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported. Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above. Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.",2025-05-25

6014,r-aqp,public,"The Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (AQP) project was started in 2009 to organize a loosely-related set of concepts and source code on the topic of soil profile visualization, aggregation, and classification into this package (aqp). Over the past 8 years, the project has grown into a suite of related R packages that enhance and simplify the quantitative analysis of soil profile data. Central to the AQP project is a new vocabulary of specialized functions and data structures that can accommodate the inherent complexity of soil profile information; freeing the scientist to focus on ideas rather than boilerplate data processing tasks <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020>. These functions and data structures have been extensively tested and documented, applied to projects involving hundreds of thousands of soil profiles, and deeply integrated into widely used tools such as SoilWeb <https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soilweb-apps/>. Components of the AQP project (aqp, soilDB, sharpshootR, soilReports packages) serve an important role in routine data analysis within the USDA-NRCS Soil Science Division. The AQP suite of R packages offer a convenient platform for bridging the gap between pedometric theory and practice.",2025-05-12

(2016, <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>; 2019, <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0222279>) and generates continuous test norm scores on the basis of the raw data from standardization samples, without requiring assumptions about the distribution of the raw data: Norm scores are directly established from raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both percentile scores and an explanatory variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes bias arising from sampling and measurement error, while handling marked deviations from normality, addressing bottom or ceiling effects and capturing almost all of the variance in the original norm data sample.

With this package, any R object can be cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R objects. The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).",2025-05-03

The package contains furthermore functions to produce documents using MS Word (or PowerPoint) and functions to import data from Excel. Many of the included functions can be found scattered in other packages and other sources written partly by Titans of R. The reason for collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives).

It can calculate pairwise distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele frequencies into account. These distances can be used for the calculation of clonal diversity statistics or used for further analysis in R. Allelic diversity statistics and Polymorphic Information Content are also available. polysat can assist the user in estimating the ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele frequencies in populations, calculate pairwise or global differentiation statistics based on those frequencies, and export allele frequencies to 'SPAGeDi' and 'adegenet'. Functions are also included for assigning alleles to isoloci in cases where one pair of microsatellite primers amplifies alleles from two or more independently segregating isoloci. polysat is described by Clark and Jasieniuk (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02985.x> and Clark and Schreier (2017) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12639>.",2025-04-30

It is provided here in a small zero-dependency package. It can be used from R as well as from 'C/C++' code in other packages as is demonstrated by four included sample packages using four distinct methods to use the PRNG presented here in client package. The implementation is influenced by our package 'RcppZiggurat' which offers a comparison among multiple alternative implementations but presented here in a lighter-weight implementation that is easier to use by other packages. The PRNGs provided are generally faster than the ones in base R: on our machine, the relative gains for normal, exponential and uniform are on the order of 7.4, 5.2 and 4.7 times faster than base R. However, these generators are of potentially lesser quality and shorter period so if in doubt use of the base R functions remains the general recommendation.",2025-04-22

Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers that are potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus genetic model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes, and all the nonzero effects were further identified by likelihood ratio test for significant QTL. The program may run on a desktop or laptop computers. If marker genotypes in association mapping population are almost homozygous, these methods in this software are very effective. If there are many heterozygous marker genotypes, the IIIVmrMLM software is recommended.

Using the 'autometric' package, a worker can proactively monitor itself in a detached background thread. The worker process itself runs normally, and the thread writes to a log every few seconds.

Additionally, the package facilitates predictive and structural analyses such as impulse responses, forecast error variance and historical decompositions, forecasting, verification of heteroskedasticity, non-normality, and hypotheses on autoregressive parameters, as well as analyses of structural shocks, volatilities, and fitted values. Beautiful plots, informative summary functions, and extensive documentation complement all this. The implemented techniques align closely with those presented in Lütkepohl, Shang, Uzeda, & Woźniak (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2404.11057>, Lütkepohl & Woźniak (2020) <doi:10.1016/j.jedc.2020.103862>, and Song & Woźniak (2021) <doi:10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.174>.",2025-04-22

9747,r-bmisc,public,"These are miscellaneous functions for working with panel data, quantiles, and printing results. For panel data, the package includes functions for making a panel data balanced (that is, dropping missing individuals that have missing observations in any time period), converting id numbers to row numbers, and to treat repeated cross sections as panel data under the assumption of rank invariance. For quantiles, there are functions to make distribution functions from a set of data points (this is particularly useful when a distribution function is created in several steps), to combine distribution functions based on some external weights, and to invert distribution functions. Finally, there are several other miscellaneous functions for obtaining weighted means, weighted distribution functions, and weighted quantiles; to generate summary statistics and their differences for two groups; and to add or drop covariates from formulas.",2025-04-22

An option is available to run a parallelized multistart optimization loop with random starting points in each iteration, which is useful for non-convex problems like MXL models or models with WTP space utility parameterizations. The main optimization loop uses the 'nloptr' package to minimize the negative log-likelihood function. Additional functions are available for computing and comparing WTP from both preference space and WTP space models and for predicting expected choices and choice probabilities for sets of alternatives based on an estimated model. Mixed logit models can include uncorrelated or correlated heterogeneity covariances and are estimated using maximum simulated likelihood based on the algorithms in Train (2009) <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511805271>.

To perform these tasks, the package builds heavily on existing machine-learning packages, such as 'caret' <https://github.com/topepo/caret/> and associated packages. The package can train multiple models, optimize model hyperparameters by performing a grid search or a random search, and evaluates model performance by different metrics. Models can be validated either on a test data set, or in case of a small sample size by k-fold cross validation or repeated bootstrapping. It also allows for 0-Hypotheses generation by performing permutation experiments. Additionally, it offers methods of model interpretation and item categorization to identify the most informative features from a high dimensional data space. The functions of this package can easily be integrated into computation pipelines (e.g. 'nextflow' <https://www.nextflow.io/>) and hereby improve scalability, standardization, and re-producibility in the context of machine-learning.",2025-04-22

11659,r-ordinalnet,public,"Fits ordinal regression models with elastic net penalty. Supported model families include cumulative probability, stopping ratio, continuation ratio, and adjacent category. These families are a subset of vector glm's which belong to a model class we call the elementwise link multinomial-ordinal (ELMO) class. Each family in this class links a vector of covariates to a vector of class probabilities. Each of these families has a parallel form, which is appropriate for ordinal response data, as well as a nonparallel form that is appropriate for an unordered categorical response, or as a more flexible model for ordinal data. The parallel model has a single set of coefficients, whereas the nonparallel model has a set of coefficients for each response category except the baseline category. It is also possible to fit a model with both parallel and nonparallel terms, which we call the semi-parallel model. The semi-parallel model has the flexibility of the nonparallel model, but the elastic net penalty shrinks it toward the parallel model.

The COding-variant Allelic Series Test (COAST) operates on the benign missense variants (BMVs), deleterious missense variants (DMVs), and protein truncating variants (PTVs) within a gene. COAST uses a set of adjustable weights that tailor the test towards rejecting the null hypothesis for genes where the average magnitude of effect increases monotonically from BMVs to DMVs to PTVs.

A manhattan plot is a popular graphical method for visualizing results from high-dimensional data analysis such as a (epi)genome wide association study (GWAS or EWAS), in which p-values, Z-scores, test statistics are plotted on a scatter plot against their genomic position. Manhattan plots are used for visualizing potential regions of interest in the genome that are associated with a phenotype. Interactive manhattan plots allow the inspection of specific value (e.g. rs number or gene name) by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into a region of the genome (e.g. a chromosome) by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area. This work is based on the 'qqman' package and the 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar manhattan and Q-Q plots as the 'manhattan' and 'qq' functions in the 'qqman' package, with the advantage of including extra annotation information and interactive web-based visualizations directly from R.

Typically they contain time-series of three-dimensional brain scans acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also contain vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data. The MGH format is named after the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the MGZ format is a compressed version of the same format. 2) 'FreeSurfer' morphometry data files in binary 'curv' format. These contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one scalar value for each vertex of a brain surface mesh. These are typically values like the cortical thickness or brain surface area at each vertex. 3) Annotation file format.

The goal is to provide simple solutions that are frequently asked for online, such as how to synchronize 'shiny' inputs without freezing the app, or how to get memory size on 'Linux' or 'MacOS' system. The enhancements roughly fall into these four categories: 1. 'shiny' input widgets; 2. high-performance computing using 'RcppParallel' and 'future' package; 3. modify R calls and convert among numbers, strings, and other objects. 4. utility functions to get system information such like CPU chip-set, memory limit, etc.",2025-04-22

The estimation is based on latent copula Gaussian models. For continuous/binary types, see Fan, J., Liu, H., Ning, Y., and Zou, H. (2017). For ternary type, see Quan X., Booth J.G. and Wells M.T. (2018) <arXiv:1809.06255>. For truncated type or zero-inflated type, see Yoon G., Carroll R.J. and Gaynanova I. (2020) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa007>.

14417,r-puniform,public,"Provides meta-analysis methods that correct for publication bias and outcome reporting bias. Four methods and a visual tool are currently included in the package. The p-uniform method as described in van Assen, van Aert, and Wicherts (2015) <https:psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-48759-001> can be used for estimating the average effect size, testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias using only the statistically significant effect sizes of primary studies. The second method in the package is the p-uniform* method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2019) <doi:10.31222/osf.io/zqjr9>. This method is an extension of the p-uniform method that allows for estimation of the average effect size and the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses both the statistically significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method in the package is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017) <doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6>. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical significance of the original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. The fourth method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302>. This method computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account publication bias in the original study. The method can also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing. The meta-plot is a visual tool for meta-analysis that provides information on the primary studies in the meta-analysis, the results of the meta-analysis, and characteristics of the research on the effect under study (van Assen et al., 2021). Helper functions to apply the Correcting for Outcome Reporting Bias (CORB) method to correct for outcome reporting bias in a meta-analysis (van Aert & Wicherts, 2021).",2025-04-22

'MOTE' provides non-central confidence intervals for each effect size, relevant test statistics, and output for reporting in APA Style (American Psychological Association, 2010, <ISBN:1433805618>) with 'LaTeX'. In research, an over-reliance on p-values may conceal the fact that a study is under-powered (Halsey, Curran-Everett, Vowler, & Drummond, 2015 <doi:10.1038/nmeth.3288>). A test may be statistically significant, yet practically inconsequential (Fritz, Scherndl, & Kühberger, 2012 <doi:10.1177/0959354312436870>). Although the American Psychological Association has long advocated for the inclusion of effect sizes (Wilkinson & American Psychological Association Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999 <doi:10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594>), the vast majority of peer-reviewed, published academic studies stop short of reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals (Cumming, 2013, <doi:10.1177/0956797613504966>).

14539,r-eikosograms,public,"An eikosogram (ancient Greek for probability picture) divides the unit square into rectangular regions whose areas, sides, and widths, represent various probabilities associated with the values of one or more categorical variates. Rectangle areas are joint probabilities, widths are always marginal (though possibly joint margins, i.e. marginal joint distributions of two or more variates), and heights of rectangles are always conditional probabilities. Eikosograms embed the rules of probability and are useful for introducing elementary probability theory, including axioms, marginal, conditional, and joint probabilities, and their relationships (including Bayes theorem as a completely trivial consequence). They are markedly superior to Venn diagrams for this purpose, especially in distinguishing probabilistic independence, mutually exclusive events, coincident events, and associations. They also are useful for identifying and understanding conditional independence structure. As data analysis tools, eikosograms display categorical data in a manner similar to Mosaic plots, especially when only two variates are involved (the only case in which they are essentially identical, though eikosograms purposely disallow spacing between rectangles). Unlike Mosaic plots, eikosograms do not alternate axes as each new categorical variate (beyond two) is introduced. Instead, only one categorical variate, designated the ""response"", presents on the vertical axis and all others, designated the ""conditioning"" variates, appear on the horizontal. In this way, conditional probability appears only as height and marginal probabilities as widths. The eikosogram is therefore much better suited to a response model analysis (e.g. logistic model) than is a Mosaic plot. Mosaic plots are better suited to log-linear style modelling as in discrete multivariate analysis. Of course, eikosograms are also suited to discrete multivariate analysis with each variate in turn appearing as the response. This makes it better suited than Mosaic plots to discrete graphical models based on conditional independence graphs (i.e. ""Bayesian Networks"" or ""BayesNets""). The eikosogram and its superiority to Venn diagrams in teaching probability is described in W.H. Cherry and R.W. Oldford (2003) <https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/papers/eikosograms/paper.pdf>, its value in exploring conditional independence structure and relation to graphical and log-linear models is described in R.W. Oldford (2003) <https://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/papers/eikosograms/independence/paper.pdf>, and a number of problems, puzzles, and paradoxes that are easily explained with eikosograms are given in R.W.

Customise graphs in many ways. Choose from colourblind-friendly 12 discreet , 3 continuous (3 palettes) and 3 divergent colour palettes. Simple code for ANOVA as ordinary (lm()) or mixed-effects linear models (lmer()), including randomised-block or repeated-measures designs. Obtain estimated marginal means and perform post-hoc comparisons on fitted models (via emmeans() wrappers). Also includes small datasets for practicing code and teaching basics before users move on to more complex designs. See vignettes for details on usage <https://grafify-vignettes.netlify.app/>.

15609,r-srs,public,"Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.

The emphasis is on complex codes that take weeks or months to run, and that have a large number of undetermined input parameters; many climate prediction models fall into this class. The emulator essentially determines Bayesian posterior estimates of the PDF of the output of a model, conditioned on results from previous runs and a user-specified prior linear model.

16097,r-collapse,public,"A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and statistical computing in R that is extremely fast, class-agnostic, and programmer friendly through a flexible, parsimonious, and robust API. Core functionality includes a rich set of S3 generic grouped and weighted statistical functions for vectors, matrices and data frames, which provide efficient low-level vectorizations and OpenMP multithreading (reducing the need for iteration/vectorization in R), and skip missing values by default. These are integrated with fast grouping and ordering algorithms (also callable from C), and efficient data manipulation functions. The package also provides a flexible and rigorous approach to time series and panel data in R. It further includes fast functions for common statistical procedures, detailed (grouped, weighted) summary statistics, powerful tools to work with nested data, fast data object conversions, functions for memory efficient R programming, and helpers to effectively deal with variable labels, attributes, and missing data. It is well integrated with basic R, 'dplyr'/'tibble', 'data.table', 'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), and accommodates (by virtue of smart internal attribute handling) many other classes (like 'ts', 'xts'/'zoo' or 'tsibble').",2025-04-22

The method formulates the problem of determining the OSB as mathematical programming problem which is solved by using a dynamic programming technique. If a dataset of the population is available to the surveyor, the method estimates its best-fit distribution and determines the OSB and OSS under Neyman allocation directly. When the dataset is not available, stratification is made based on the assumption that the values of the study variable, y, are available as hypothetical realizations of proxy values of y from recent surveys. Thus, it requires certain distributional assumptions about the study variable. At present, it handles stratification for the populations where the study variable follows a continuous distribution, namely, Pareto, Triangular, Right-triangular, Weibull, Gamma, Exponential, Uniform, Normal, Log-normal and Cauchy distributions.",2025-04-22

The standard Plackett-Luce model is generalized to accommodate ties of any order in the ranking. Partial rankings, in which only a subset of items are ranked in each ranking, are also accommodated in the implementation. Disconnected/weakly connected networks implied by the rankings may be handled by adding pseudo-rankings with a hypothetical item. Optionally, a multivariate normal prior may be set on the log-worth parameters and ranker reliabilities may be incorporated as proposed by Raman and Joachims (2014) <doi:10.1145/2623330.2623654>.

(2017) <doi:10.1038/srep42362>. In order to support genome-wide analyses, these models are designed to accept any type of protein as input and calculation of compositional properties has been optimised for high-throughput use. For best results it is important to select the model that accurately represents your sequence type: for full length proteins, it is recommended to use the default ""precursor"" model. The alternative, ""mature"", model is best suited for mature peptide sequences that represent the final antimicrobial peptide sequence after post-translational processing.

Ordinary R vectors are unsuitable for working with values of associative maps because elements of an R vector may be accessed by reference to their location in the vector, but associative maps are stored in arbitrary order. However, when associating keys with values one needs both parts to be in 1-1 correspondence, so one cannot dispense with the order entirely. The 'disordR' package includes a single S4 class, disord. This class allows one to perform only those operations appropriate for manipulating values of associative maps and prevents any other operation (such as accessing an element at a particular location). A useful heuristic is that one is only allowed to access or modify a disord object using a python list comprehension. The idea is to prevent ill-defined operations on values (or keys) of associative maps, whose order is undefined or at best implementation-specific, while allowing and facilitating sensible operations. The package is needed for development versions of 'mvp', 'hyper2', 'spray', 'clifford', and 'freealg'.",2025-04-22

Because of the large size of the chromosomes, it is impractical to visualize each element on the same plot. However, the plot provides a magnified view for each of chromosome locus to render additional information and visualization specific for that location. You can map thousands of genes and can view all mappings easily. Users can investigate the detailed information about the mappings (like gene names or total genes mapped on a location) or can view the magnified single or double stranded view of the chromosome at a location showing each mapped element in sequential order. The package provide multiple features like visualizing multiple sets, chromosome heat-maps, group annotations, adding hyperlinks, and labelling. The plots can be saved as HTML documents that can be customized and shared easily. In addition, you can include them in R Markdown or in R 'Shiny' applications.",2025-04-22

In addition, the ensembles can be pruned using the option 'newmfinal' in the predict.bagging() and predict.boosting() functions and the posterior probability of each class for observations can be obtained. Version 3.1 modifies the relative importance measure to take into account the gain of the Gini index given by a variable in each tree and the weights of these trees. Version 4.0 includes the margin-based ordered aggregation for Bagging pruning (Guo and Boukir, 2013) and a function to auto prune the 'rpart' tree. Moreover, three new plots are also available importanceplot(), plot.errorevol() and plot.margins(). Version 4.1 allows to predict on unlabeled data. Version 4.2 includes the parallel computation option for some of the functions.",2025-04-22

The techniques in the package are detailed in the paper ""Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents"" by Mikolov et al. (2014), available at <arXiv:1405.4053>. The package also provides an implementation to cluster documents based on these embedding using a technique called top2vec. Top2vec finds clusters in text documents by combining techniques to embed documents and words and density-based clustering. It does this by embedding documents in the semantic space as defined by the 'doc2vec' algorithm. Next it maps these document embeddings to a lower-dimensional space using the 'Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection' (UMAP) clustering algorithm and finds dense areas in that space using a 'Hierarchical Density-Based Clustering' technique (HDBSCAN). These dense areas are the topic clusters which can be represented by the corresponding topic vector which is an aggregate of the document embeddings of the documents which are part of that topic cluster. In the same semantic space similar words can be found which are representative of the topic. More details can be found in the paper 'Top2Vec: Distributed Representations of Topics' by D. Angelov available at <arXiv:2008.09470>.",2025-04-22

Only numerical variables are allowed, however, categorical variables can be transformed into dummies and used with the Bernoulli distribution. The implementation is largely based on the paper ""A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail filtering"" written by K.M. Schneider (2003) <doi:10.3115/1067807.1067848>.

Prior distributions on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the mixture of g-priors from Liang et al (2008) <DOI:10.1198/016214507000001337> for linear models or mixtures of g-priors from Li and Clyde (2019) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2018.1469992> in generalized linear models. Other model selection criteria include AIC, BIC and Empirical Bayes estimates of g. Sampling probabilities may be updated based on the sampled models using sampling w/out replacement or an efficient MCMC algorithm which samples models using a tree structure of the model space as an efficient hash table. See Clyde, Ghosh and Littman (2010) <DOI:10.1198/jcgs.2010.09049> for details on the sampling algorithms. Uniform priors over all models or beta-binomial prior distributions on model size are allowed, and for large p truncated priors on the model space may be used to enforce sampling models that are full rank. The user may force variables to always be included in addition to imposing constraints that higher order interactions are included only if their parents are included in the model.

18447,r-datavisualizations,public,"Gives access to data visualisation methods that are relevant from the data scientist's point of view. The flagship idea of 'DataVisualizations' is the mirrored density plot (MD-plot) for either classified or non-classified multivariate data published in Thrun, M.C. et al.: ""Analyzing the Fine Structure of Distributions"" (2020), PLoS ONE, <DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0238835>. The MD-plot outperforms the box-and-whisker diagram (box plot), violin plot and bean plot and geom_violin plot of ggplot2. Furthermore, a collection of various visualization methods for univariate data is provided. In the case of exploratory data analysis, 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through a combination of four methods. One of these methods is the Pareto density estimation (PDE) of the probability density function (pdf). Additionally, visualizations of the distribution of distances using PDE, the scatter-density plot using PDE for two variables as well as the Shepard density plot and the Bland-Altman plot are presented here. Pertaining to classified high-dimensional data, a number of visualizations are described, such as f.ex. the heat map and silhouette plot. A political map of the world or Germany can be visualized with the additional information defined by a classification of countries or regions. By extending the political map further, an uncomplicated function for a Choropleth map can be used which is useful for measurements across a geographic area. For categorical features, the Pie charts, slope charts and fan plots, improved by the ABC analysis, become usable. More detailed explanations are found in the book by Thrun, M.C.: ""Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence"" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.",2025-04-22

For each of those utilities, this package provides an R wrapper whose formal arguments closely mirror those of the 'GDAL' command line interface. The utilities operate on data stored in files and typically write their output to other files. Therefore, to process data stored in any of R's more common spatial formats (i.e. those supported by the 'sp', 'sf', and 'raster' packages), first write them to disk, then process them with the package's wrapper functions before reading the outputted results back into R.

For the GSMs, g(S(t|x))=eta(t,x) for a link function g, survival S at time t with covariates x and a linear predictor eta(t,x). The main assumption is that the time effect(s) are smooth <doi:10.1177/0962280216664760>. For fully parametric models with natural splines, this re-implements Stata's 'stpm2' function, which are flexible parametric survival models developed by Royston and colleagues. We have extended the parametric models to include any smooth parametric smoothers for time. We have also extended the model to include any smooth penalized smoothers from the 'mgcv' package, using penalized likelihood. These models include left truncation, right censoring, interval censoring, gamma frailties and normal random effects <doi:10.1002/sim.7451>. For the smooth AFTs, S(t|x) = S_0(t*eta(t,x)), where the baseline survival function S_0(t)=exp(-exp(eta_0(t))) is modelled for natural splines for eta_0, and the time-dependent cumulative acceleration factor eta(t,x)=\int_0^t exp(eta_1(u,x)) du for log acceleration factor eta_1(u,x). The Markov multi-state models allow for a range of models with smooth transitions to predict transition probabilities, length of stay, utilities and costs, with differences, ratios and standardisation.",2025-04-22

It is also able to handle new data within the original domain via linear interpolation. The package is built to estimate the best normalizing transformation for a vector consistently and accurately. It implements the Box-Cox transformation, the Yeo-Johnson transformation, three types of Lambert WxF transformations, and the ordered quantile normalization transformation. It also estimates the normalization efficacy of other commonly used transformations, and finally it allows users to specify custom transformations or normalization statistics.",2025-04-22

The transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x F distribution. This package contains functions to model and analyze skewed, heavy-tailed data the Lambert Way: simulate random samples, estimate parameters, compute quantiles, and plot/ print results nicely. Probably the most important function is 'Gaussianize', which works similarly to 'scale', but actually makes the data Gaussian.

Both lines filter the features first then combine the filtered features to make the list of all the possible rules (i.e. rule1: feature1 < feature2, rule2: feature1 < feature3, etc...). Then the list of rules will be filtered and the most important and informative rules will be kept. The informative rules will be assembled in an one-vs-rest model or in an RF model.

The 'multiApply' package extends this paradigm with its only function, Apply, which efficiently applies functions taking one or a list of multiple unidimensional or multidimensional arrays (or combinations thereof) as input. The input arrays can have different numbers of dimensions as well as different dimension lengths, and the applied function can return one or a list of unidimensional or multidimensional arrays as output. This saves development time by preventing the R user from writing often error-prone and memory-inefficient loops dealing with multiple complex arrays. Also, a remarkable feature of Apply is the transparent use of multi-core through its parameter 'ncores'. In contrast to the base apply function, this package suggests the use of 'target dimensions' as opposite to the 'margins' for specifying the dimensions relevant to the function to be applied.",2025-04-22

Now faster and more memory efficient; determining the whole hierarchy for datasets of 10M points in low dimensional Euclidean spaces or 100K points in high-dimensional ones takes only 1-2 minutes. Allows clustering with respect to mutual reachability distances so that it can act as a noise point detector or a robustified version of 'HDBSCAN*' (that is able to detect a predefined number of clusters and hence it does not dependent on the somewhat fragile 'eps' parameter). The package also features an implementation of economic inequity indices (the Gini, Bonferroni index) and external cluster validity measures (partition similarity scores; e.g., the adjusted Rand, Fowlkes-Mallows, adjusted mutual information, pair sets index). See also the 'Python' version of 'genieclust' available on 'PyPI', which supports sparse data, more metrics, and even larger datasets.",2025-04-22

The nimbleFunction system makes it easy to do things like implement new MCMC samplers from R, customize the assignment of samplers to different parts of a model from R, and compile the new samplers automatically via C++ alongside the samplers 'NIMBLE' provides. 'NIMBLE' extends the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language by making it extensible: New distributions and functions can be added, including as calls to external compiled code. Although most people think of MCMC as the main goal of the 'BUGS'/'JAGS' language for writing models, one can use 'NIMBLE' for writing arbitrary other kinds of model-generic algorithms as well.

Anyone can add additional, customized, progression handlers. The 'progressr' package uses R's condition framework for signaling progress updated. Because of this, progress can be reported from almost anywhere in R, e.g. from classical for and while loops, from map-reduce APIs like the lapply() family of functions, 'purrr', 'plyr', and 'foreach'. It will also work with parallel processing via the 'future' framework, e.g. future.apply::future_lapply(), furrr::future_map(), and 'foreach' with 'doFuture'.

A re-implementation of Akimas spline interpolation (akima::interp(..., linear=FALSE)) is currently under development and will complete this package in a later version. Estimators for partial derivatives are already available, these are a prerequisite for the spline interpolation. The basic part is currently a GPLed triangulation algorithm (sweep hull algorithm by David Sinclair) providing the starting point for the piecewise linear interpolator.

Amelia II implements our bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches, is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can handle many more variables. Unlike Amelia I and other statistically rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please let us know if you find to the contrary!). The program also generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values of missing cells in their data. Amelia II also includes useful diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.

RST was introduced by Zdzisław Pawlak in 1982 as a sophisticated mathematical tool to model and process imprecise or incomplete information. By using the indiscernibility relation for objects/instances, RST does not require additional parameters to analyze the data. FRST is an extension of RST.

Float vectors/matrices have half the precision of their ""numeric""-type counterparts but are generally faster to numerically operate on, for a performance vs accuracy trade-off. The internal representation is an S4 class, which allows us to keep the syntax identical to that of base R's. Interaction between floats and base types for binary operators is generally possible; in these cases, type promotion always defaults to the higher precision.

For ease of use, the 'parDist' function extends the signature of the 'dist' function and uses the same parameter naming conventions as distance methods of existing R packages. The package is mainly implemented in C++ and leverages the 'RcppParallel' package to parallelize the distance computations with the help of the 'TinyThread' library. Furthermore, the 'Armadillo' linear algebra library is used for optimized matrix operations during distance calculations. The curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP) technique is applied to avoid virtual functions, which improves the Dynamic Time Warping calculations while the implementation stays flexible enough to support different DTW step patterns and normalization methods.",2025-04-22

(2017) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asx046>, or through the direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum likelihood estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as in Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592>. See Kosmidis et al (2020) <doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09860-6> for more details. Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are provided. In the special case of generalized linear models for binomial and multinomial responses (both ordinal and nominal), the adjusted score approaches to mean and media bias reduction have been found to return estimates with improved frequentist properties, that are also always finite, even in cases where the maximum likelihood estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and quasi-complete separation; see Kosmidis and Firth, 2020 <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa052>, for a proof for mean bias reduction in logistic regression).",2025-04-22

The package also provides the 'enriched_glm' function that has the same interface as 'glm' but results in objects of class 'enriched_glm'. In addition to the usual components in a `glm` object, 'enriched_glm' objects carry an object-specific simulate method and functions to compute the scores, the observed and expected information matrix, the first-order bias, as well as model densities, probabilities, and quantiles at arbitrary parameter values.

The original 'dparser' package documentation can be found at <http://dparser.sourceforge.net/>. This allows you to add mini-languages to R (like RxODE's ODE mini-language Wang, Hallow, and James 2015 <DOI:10.1002/psp4.12052>) or to parse other languages like 'NONMEM' to automatically translate them to R code. To use this in your code, add a LinkingTo dparser in your DESCRIPTION file and instead of using #include <dparse.h> use #include <dparser.h>. This also provides a R-based port of the make_dparser <http://dparser.sourceforge.net/d/make_dparser.cat> command called mkdparser(). Additionally you can parse an arbitrary grammar within R using the dparse() function, which works on most OSes and is mainly for grammar testing.

This package is a wrapper around libtiff (www.libtiff.org), on which it depends (i.e. the libtiff shared library must be on your PATH for the binary to work, and tiffio.h must be on your system to build the package from source). By using libtiff's highlevel TIFFReadRGBAImage function, this package inherently supports a wide range of image formats and compression schemes. This package also provides an implementation of the Ridler Autothresholding algorithm for easy generation of binary masks as described in Ridler & Calvard (1978) <doi:10.1109/TSMC.1978.4310039>.",2025-04-22

When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa(). This function further allows to simulate under epidemiological models with an exposed class.

Each PA is optimized such that the corresponding PC has maximum additional variance not explained by the previous components. In contrast, the function 'nscumcomp' jointly computes all PCs such that the cumulative variance is maximal. Both functions have the same interface as the 'prcomp' function from the 'stats' package (plus some extra parameters), and both return the result of the analysis as an object of class 'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.

Cluster prototypes are the data elements, i.e. centroids or medoids, representing the clusters in a data set. In order to initialize cluster prototypes, the package 'inaparc' contains a set of the functions that are the implementations of several linear time-complexity and loglinear time-complexity methods in addition to some novel techniques. Initialization of fuzzy membership degrees matrices is another important task for starting the probabilistic and possibilistic partitioning algorithms. In order to initialize membership degrees matrices required by these algorithms, a number of functions based on some traditional and novel initialization techniques are also available in the package 'inaparc'.",2025-04-22

Bioinformatics; 2012 Mar 15;28(6):755-62 is implemented. The experimental setting and estimation details are described in detail there. Briefly, integration of new DNA in a host genome (due to retroviral infection or gene therapy) can be tracked using DNA sequencing, potentially allowing characterization of the abundance of individual cell clones bearing distinct integration sites. The locations of integration sites can be determined by fragmenting the host DNA (via sonication or fragmentase), breaking the newly integrated DNA at a known sequence, amplifying the fragments containing both host and integrated DNA, sequencing those amplicons, then mapping the host sequences to positions on the reference genome. The relative number of fragments containing a given position in the host genome estimates the relative abundance of cells hosting the corresponding integration site, but that number is not available and the count of amplicons per fragment varies widely. However, the expected number of distinct fragment lengths is a function of the abundance of cells hosting an integration site at a given position and a certain nuisance parameter. The algorithm implicitly estimates that function to estimate the relative abundance.",2025-04-22

In the graph estimation stage, the graph structure is estimated by Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation or the graphical lasso, and both methods can be further accelerated by the lossy screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable by correlation thresholding. We target on high-dimensional data analysis usually d >> n, and the computation is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation thresholding graph estimation.

To answer this, a model can be created were the performance statistic is the resampling statistics (e.g. accuracy or RMSE). These values are explained by the model types. In doing this, we can get parameter estimates for each model's affect on performance and make statistical (and practical) comparisons between models.

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit -- among others -- linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. Model fit can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation.

Hover the mouse pointer over a cell to show details or drag a rectangle to zoom. A 'heatmap' is a popular graphical method for visualizing high-dimensional data, in which a table of numbers are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The rows and columns of the matrix are ordered to highlight patterns and are often accompanied by 'dendrograms'. 'Heatmaps' are used in many fields for visualizing observations, correlations, missing values patterns, and more. Interactive 'heatmaps' allow the inspection of specific value by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into a region of the 'heatmap' by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area. This work is based on the 'ggplot2' and 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar 'heatmaps' as 'heatmap.2' or 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed ('plotly.js' is able to handle larger size matrix), the ability to zoom from the 'dendrogram' panes, and the placing of factor variables in the sides of the 'heatmap'.",2025-04-22

26943,r-mixomics,public,"Multivariate methods are well suited to large omics data sets where the number of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). They have the appealing properties of reducing the dimension of the data by using instrumental variables (components), which are defined as combinations of all variables. Those components are then used to produce useful graphical outputs that enable better understanding of the relationships and correlation structures between the different data sets that are integrated. mixOmics offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection. The package proposes several sparse multivariate models we have developed to identify the key variables that are highly correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome of interest. The data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high throughput sequencing technologies, such as omics data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics etc) but also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging). The methods implemented in mixOmics can also handle missing values without having to delete entire rows with missing data. A non exhaustive list of methods include variants of generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares and sparse Discriminant Analysis.

27662,r-ff,public,"The ff package provides data structures that are stored on disk but behave (almost) as if they were in RAM by transparently mapping only a section (pagesize) in main memory - the effective virtual memory consumption per ff object. ff supports R''s standard atomic data types ''double'', ''logical'', ''raw'' and ''integer'' and non-standard atomic types boolean (1 bit), quad (2 bit unsigned), nibble (4 bit unsigned), byte (1 byte signed with NAs), ubyte (1 byte unsigned), short (2 byte signed with NAs), ushort (2 byte unsigned), single (4 byte float with NAs). For example ''quad'' allows efficient storage of genomic data as an ''A'',''T'',''G'',''C'' factor. The unsigned types support ''circular'' arithmetic. There is also support for close-to-atomic types ''factor'', ''ordered'', ''POSIXct'', ''Date'' and custom close-to-atomic types. ff not only has native C-support for vectors, matrices and arrays with flexible dimorder (major column-order, major row-order and generalizations for arrays). There is also a ffdf class not unlike data.frames and import/export filters for csv files. ff objects store raw data in binary flat files in native encoding, and complement this with metadata stored in R as physical and virtual attributes. ff objects have well-defined hybrid copying semantics, which gives rise to certain performance improvements through virtualization. ff objects can be stored and reopened across R sessions. ff files can be shared by multiple ff R objects (using different data en/de-coding schemes) in the same process or from multiple R processes to exploit parallelism. A wide choice of finalizer options allows to work with ''permanent'' files as well as creating/removing ''temporary'' ff files completely transparent to the user. On certain OS/Filesystem combinations, creating the ff files works without notable delay thanks to using sparse file allocation. Several access optimization techniques such as Hybrid Index Preprocessing and Virtualization are implemented to achieve good performance even with large datasets, for example virtual matrix transpose without touching a single byte on disk. Further, to reduce disk I/O, ''logicals'' and non-standard data types get stored native and compact on binary flat files i.e. logicals take up exactly 2 bits to represent TRUE, FALSE and NA. Beyond basic access functions, the ff package also provides compatibility functions that facilitate writing code for ff and ram objects and support for batch processing on ff objects (e.g. as.ram, as.ff, ffapply). ff interfaces closely with functionality from package ''bit'': chunked looping, fast bit operations and coercions between different objects that can store subscript information (''bit'', ''bitwhich'', ff ''boolean'', ri range index, hi hybrid index). This allows to work interactively with selections of large datasets and quickly modify selection criteria. Further high-performance enhancements can be made available upon request.",2025-04-22

The interpretation of stochastic dominance requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF of the other. 'dunn.test' makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on Dunn's z-test-statistic approximations to the actual rank statistics. The null hypothesis for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected value from the first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the second group equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous, and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location, Dunn's test may be understood as a test for median difference.

For Kriging there is an easy to use function that also estimates the correlation scale (range parameter).

Functions rstring() and rcat() make it easy to process RSP strings, rsource() sources an RSP file as it was an R script, while rfile() compiles it (even online) into its final output format, e.g. rfile('report.tex.rsp') generates 'report.pdf' and rfile('report.md.rsp') generates 'report.html'. RSP is ideal for self-contained scientific reports and R package vignettes. It's easy to use - if you know how to write an R script, you'll be up and running within minutes.",2025-04-22

The approach is both computationally as well as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to ""small n, large p"" data, and always returns a positive definite and well-conditioned covariance matrix. In addition to inferring the covariance matrix the package also provides shrinkage estimators for partial correlations and partial variances. The inverse of the covariance and correlation matrix can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary power of the shrinkage correlation matrix. Furthermore, functions are available for fast singular value decomposition, for computing the pseudoinverse, and for checking the rank and positive definiteness of a matrix.",2025-04-22

Compare this to the naive approach which takes O(N*M) time to loop through each pattern and scan for it in the text. This implementation builds the trie (the generic name of the data structure) and runs the search in a single function call. If you want to search multiple texts with the same trie, the function will take a list or vector of texts and return a list of matches to each text. By default, all 128 ASCII characters are allowed in both the keywords and the text. A more efficient trie is possible if the alphabet size can be reduced. For example, DNA sequences use at most 19 distinct characters and usually only 4; protein sequences use at most 26 distinct characters and usually only 20.

ROCR is a flexible tool for creating cutoff-parameterized 2D performance curves by freely combining two from over 25 performance measures (new performance measures can be added using a standard interface). Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only three commands and reasonable default values for all optional parameters.",2025-04-22

This package uses methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes, vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally share the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many additional options to allow customizing the generation and processing of JSON content.

Currently only fixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination (CAO).

28610,r-bit,public,"True boolean datatype (no NAs), coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such components are used more than once. Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing. All three index classes can be used for subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).",2025-04-22
